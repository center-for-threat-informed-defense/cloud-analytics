## Guidance

### Getting Started

The project currently uses Python 3.8, which must be installed prior to project setup.

The following commands may be useful in getting the project setup locally. All commands should be run from the project root directory.

* Build Python virtualenv
  * `make venv`
* Install all development dependencies
  * `make install-dev`
* Activate newly created virtualenv
  * `source .venv/bin/activate`
* Update dependency resolution (after updating appropriate `*.in` file, see _Updating Dependencies_ section below)
  * Runtime dependency update
    * `make requirements.txt`
  * Development dependency update
    * `make requirements/dev.txt`
* Setup pre-commit (required one-time process per local `git clone` repository)
  * `pre-commit install`
* Manually run pre-commit hooks without performing a commit
  * `make pre-commit-run`
* Build container image
  * `make build-container`


### Proposing Changes

* Please open a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (PR) against the `main` branch for any desired changes. The PR will be reviewed by the project team.
* Note that all PR checks must pass to be eligible for merge approval.

### Updating Dependencies

1. Add new dependency in either `requirements/requirements.in`, _or_ `requirements/dev.in`, depending on if the new dependency is a runtime or development time dependency, respectively.
2. Run `make requirements.txt` or `make requirements/dev.txt`, depending on the file updated in the previous step.
3. Add all modified files to the changeset (e.g. `requirements.txt`, `requirements/dev.txt`, `requirements/requirements.in`, `requirements/dev.in`).
4. Push the changes.
